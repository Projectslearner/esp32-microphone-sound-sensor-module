# ESP32 Microphone Sound Sensor Module ProjecT

## Project Overview
The ESP32 Microphone Sound Sensor Module project demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller to read sound levels from a microphone sound sensor. This project can be used to monitor ambient sound levels and trigger actions based on the detected sound intensity.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Microphone Sound Sensor Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Microphone Sound Sensor to ESP32:**
   - **Sound Sensor Output:** Connect the analog output pin of the sound sensor module to GPIO 34 on the ESP32.
   - **Power and Ground:** Connect the VCC and GND pins of the sound sensor module to the 3.3V and GND pins of the ESP32, respectively.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication in the `setup()` function using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - Set the sound sensor pin as an input using `pinMode(soundSensorPin, INPUT)`.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the analog value from the sound sensor using `analogRead(soundSensorPin)`.
     - Store the reading in the `soundValue` variable.
     - Print the sound level to the Serial Monitor for monitoring and debugging.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensitivity:** Adjust the position and sensitivity of the sound sensor module for accurate sound detection based on the project‚Äôs requirements.
   - **Noise Filtering:** Implement software filtering or averaging techniques to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of sound level readings.
   - **Thresholds:** Define thresholds for sound levels to trigger specific actions or events, such as turning on an LED or sending a notification.

## Applications
- **Noise Monitoring:** Monitor ambient noise levels in a room or environment and take action if the sound level exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Voice Activation:** Detect sound or voice commands to activate or control devices.
- **Security Systems:** Use sound detection as a part of a security system to detect unusual noises or activities.

## Notes
- **Analog Readings:** The ESP32‚Äôs ADC provides a resolution of 12 bits, resulting in analog values ranging from 0 to 4095.
- **Sound Sensitivity:** Ensure the sound sensor module is placed in an appropriate location to capture the desired sound levels accurately.
